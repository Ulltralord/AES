# AES

This is a software implementation of the algorithm AES with a key length of 128 bits and CBC mode. This program allows you to encrypt/decrypt files and directories. The program can be compiled to run on Linux and Windows systems. In the first case, you need to add 3 files to the project that emulate the work of Windows functions in Linux: _findfirst(), _findnext() and _findclose().
